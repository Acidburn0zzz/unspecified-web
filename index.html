        Parts of the Web stack are supported by browsers but not specified by standards. Needless to
        say, this hurts interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to gather pieces of the Web stack that developers know can be
        useful but that aren't specified in an interoperable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features that are eligible should be supported by more than one browser, even if perhaps
        differently between browsers. If you feel that a given browser sports a particularly
        important yet unspecified feature but is the only implementation for it feel free to make
        the case for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this is <strong>not</strong> a document in which to list features you would
        <em>like</em> to see on the Web but aren't available in any implementation. For that, we
        recommend that you discuss the matter in
        <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discussion is open to all. If you would like to add some content, please make a 
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/unspecified-web/">pull requests</a> (just follow the way in
        which the rest of the HTML is structured). If you are unsure, or just want to signal a
        problem, just <a href="https://github.com/w3c/unspecified-web/issues">file an issue</a>.
