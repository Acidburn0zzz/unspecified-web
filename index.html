        Parts of the Web stack are supported by browsers but not specified by standards. Needless to
        say, this hurts interoperability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this document is to gather pieces of the Web stack that developers know can be
        useful but that aren't specified in an interoperable manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features that are eligible should be supported by more than one browser, even if perhaps
        differently between browsers. If you feel that a given browser sports a particularly
        important yet unspecified feature but is the only implementation for it feel free to make
        the case for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this is <strong>not</strong> a document in which to list features you would
        <em>like</em> to see on the Web but aren't available in any implementation. For that, we
        recommend that you discuss the matter in
        <a href="http://discourse.specifiction.org/">Discourse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discussion is open to all. If you would like to add some content, please make a 
        <a href="https://github.com/w3c/unspecified-web/">pull requests</a> (just follow the way in
        which the rest of the HTML is structured). If you are unsure, or just want to signal a
        problem, just <a href="https://github.com/w3c/unspecified-web/issues">file an issue</a>.

      <h2>Markup</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with HTML, SVG, or MathML as languages.

      <h2>CSS</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with styling.

      <h2>APIs</h2>
      <p>
        This section is for unspecified features to do with APIs and scripting in general.

      <section>
        <h2><code>window.find()</code></h2>
        <p>
          This method finds a string in the DOM in the same way that the browserâ€™s find
          functionality does. Its design is somewhat horrible but it is used by actual libraries and
          code in the wild.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is some <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/find">documentation</a> on
          MDN, as well as an <a
          href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=672395">interesting bug</a> on the
          topic. IE has it as <a
          href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms536422.aspx"><code>findText()</code></a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          This should:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Be specified sufficiently to be interoperable and work with existing content.</li>
          <li>
            Be complemented with a more modern API able to find <code>Range</code>s based on a
            search string.
          </li>
        </ol>
